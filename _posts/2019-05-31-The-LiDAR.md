# What Is LiDAR and How LiDAR Work
LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to a object.  A LiDAR instrument principally consists of a laser, a scanner, and a specialized GPS receiver.

Most LiDARs for autonomous driving mount their laser emitters and receivers to a rotating motor to achieve a 360-degree view, with a typical refresh rate at 10Hz . The horizontal angular resolution of the LiDAR depends on the numbers of emitters and receivers it has. The vertical angular resolution depends on the installation angles of each emitter. 


# Autonomous Vehicle And LiDAR

LiDARs has been a part of the perception system on the autonomous vehicle since the early 90s. Most of the autonomous driving platforms today are equipped or even build around LiDARs. 

Compared to other types of sensors, LiDAR has the following advantages:
- Highly accurate depth information.
- Invariant to most of the lighting conditions.
- Decent resolution and range depending on your model.
- Invariant  to most weather conditions

However, it is not to say the LiDAR is a perfect sensor for autonomous driving. There are several severe disadvantages:
- Too expensive
- Cost too much
- Most of the time leads to an empty pocket
- Deep learning-based algorithms for point cloud processing is still under active research.
- New types of LiDAR for autonomous driving is under active development, which could be very different from LiDAR used today.
- Data size is huge.

One example of perception systems on autonomous car is shown in Fig.2. Waymo's most rencent autonomous vehicles are equipped with 5 LiDARs, which are all developed by Google.

The high-resolution LiDAR on the top of the vehicle is fused with panoramic cameras. This enables fusion between images and point clouds, which can boost the texture detail that point cloud lacks.

The low-resolution LiDARs on the body of the vehicle is fused with radar.  This allows accurate speed measuring of objects, which can be projected to point clouds.
