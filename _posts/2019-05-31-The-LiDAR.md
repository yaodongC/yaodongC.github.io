# What Is LiDAR and How LiDAR Work
LiDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, is a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges (variable distances) to a object.  A LiDAR instrument principally consists of a laser, a scanner, and a specialized GPS receiver.

LiDARs has been a part of the perception system on the autonomous vehicle since the early 90s. Most of the autonomous driving platforms today are equipped with one or multiple LiDARs. 

Compared to other types of sensors, LiDAR has the following advantages:
- Highly accurate depth information.
- Invariant to most of the lighting conditions.
- Decent resolution and range depending on your model.

However, it is not to say the LiDAR is a perfect sensor for  autonomous driving. There are several severe disadvantages:
- Too expensive
- Cost too much
- Most of the time leads to a empty pocket
